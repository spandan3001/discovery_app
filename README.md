# Flutter Discovery App with GetX

This Flutter app demonstrates a simple implementation of a discovery page with pagination. The app fetches data from a mock API and displays it in a paginated manner using the GetX state management library.

## Features

- **Discovery Page:** Implement a Flutter screen that displays cards representing items fetched from a mock API.
- **API Integration:** Use the provided API endpoint to fetch mock data with query parameters for pagination.
- **Pagination:** Implement infinite scroll to load more items as the user reaches the bottom of the list.
- **GetX State Management:** Utilize the GetX package for efficient state management in Flutter.
